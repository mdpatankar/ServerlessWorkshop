# Serverless Workshop

Welcome to the Serverless Workshop featuring [Apache Openwhisk](http://openwhisk.incubator.apache.org/).

This workshop will teach you how to develop serverless applications, composed of loosely coupled microservice-like functions, using an open-source serverless platform.

By the end of the workshop you should be set up with a development environment and learnt how to create and invoke actions
